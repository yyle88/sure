# sure: Add Assertions and Crash Handling to Existing Go Code

`sure` enhances your existing Go code by adding assertions and crash handling. It automatically asserts conditions and crashes when errors occur, allowing you to improve error handling in legacy code without needing to manually add repetitive checks.

## CHINESE README

## Packages Overview

### `sure_cls_gen`: **Generates Go Classes with Assertions**

Generates Go classes from predefined objects, embedding assertion logic to prevent common errors.

### `sure_pkg_gen`: **Generates Go Packages with Error Handling**

Extracts functions from existing code and generates Go packages, integrating assertion and crash handling.

### `cls_stub_gen`: **Generates Package-Level Function Wrappers**

Creates package-level functions that wrap methods of a singleton struct, simplifying access usage.

## Usage
