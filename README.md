# sure: Add Assertions and Crash Handling to Existing Go Code

`sure` enhances your existing Go code by adding assertions and crash handling. It automatically asserts conditions and crashes when errors occur, allowing you to improve error handling in legacy code without needing to manually add repetitive checks.
